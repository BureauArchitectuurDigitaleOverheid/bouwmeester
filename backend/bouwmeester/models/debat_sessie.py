"""The channel that was set up for one debate.

A row is the answer to "is there already a channel for this debate?", and
later the place where the listening worker finds what to listen to.

The key is the activiteit from the TK API, not a Debat Direct debate. A
convocatie arrives days to weeks ahead (median 20.5 days, measured over 80
convocaties), and Debat Direct does not know the debate until the day
itself. The activiteit already exists.

Own table, not a third scope on `mattermost_channel_link`: a linked channel
is read for leads and notes, and a debate channel must not be.
