"""Marking questions: what is the bewindspersoon asked in this debate.

When a turn at speaking is finished, the transcription hands it to
`DebatVraagService.beoordeel_beurt`. A model reads that one turn, with what
is known about the debate and the list of questions that are still open,
and says which questions to the bewindspersoon are in it. Each new question
is recorded, becomes a reply under the message of the turn, and shows up in
the status line of that message.

A question is a state, not an event. The model has no memory of the debate;
the table has. Every call gets the open questions of the speaker as a short
list, and a question they ask again becomes a vermelding on the row that is
there instead of a second thread.

Order of work, and why:

1. The answer of the model is stored in one commit, threads not yet posted.
   From then on the turn counts as judged: a second call for the same turn
   does not ask the model again, so it cannot mark other questions.
2. Each thread is posted while its row is locked, and the post id is
   committed before anything else happens. A post that fails leaves the row
   without a thread, and the next call tries it again.
3. The status line counts only questions that have a thread, and is written
   last. It is derived from the table, so writing it twice is harmless.

The service commits. It never rolls back: nothing is left half done between
two commits, and a rollback would expire what the caller holds.

        Vraag 12 · aan de minister · [21:55](<link>)
        📄 <agenda document>
        > <the quote>

    A question that asks for something on paper, or that a toezegging was
    linked to, gets one short line more, under the line that was there:

        ❓ **<the question>**
        Vraag 12 · aan de minister · [21:55](<link>)
        ✉️ een overzicht, vóór de begrotingsbehandeling · 🤝 toezegging 15
        > <the quote>

    The second line stays what it was for every question, 34 characters
    with the time in a fixed place; with the request in it, it came to
    three lines on a phone. `vraagt_om` is what is asked for, the word
    the member used in a fixed spelling (`debat_vraag_brief.PRODUCTS`),
    and `termijn` by when, in the member's words. `later_om` and
    `later_termijn` are the same for a question that asked for nothing on
    paper when it was marked and was asked again later for a letter: the
    quote of this reply names no letter, so the line says it came later.
    `toegezegd` are the numbers of the toezeggingen that answer this
    question; their replies say "bij vraag 12", so the two read as a pair
    from either side. None of it says where the question stands: that is
    for the people who follow the debate.

    Who asks is not in it: the reply hangs under the message of the
    speaker. The number is the one of the markering in this debate, so
    people can say "vraag 12".

    Everything in it comes from outside: the quote from the transcript,
    the summary from a model that read the transcript. All of it is
    escaped; the bold and the link are ours.

    `moment` and `moment_url` are the start of the turn and the link to
    it. With `vraag_moment` the time shown is that of the question, and
    the link opens just before it. Without it, both are the turn's and the
    line says so.

    `status` is where the question stands and `door` who picked it up, as
    the reactions on the reply have it. The icon in front of the question
    becomes that of the status, and the words go into the line below, so
    the state of every question can be read down the left side of a
    thread. The reply is made from the row every time, never from what is
    in the channel: writing it twice gives the same text, and nothing in
    it can get lost.

      and a question in their turn is one they repeat or put to the room.

    Measured on the three debates these were made on, over five runs: the
    checks took away 12 to 21 of the 26 to 43 wrong markings per run and
    not one question the labeller was sure of.

    A question that is kept is looked at once more, by rule: whether it
    asks for something on paper, and by when (`paper_request`). That adds
    a property to the question and never drops or adds one.

    A member who comes back to a question that got no answer often asks
    for a letter then ("Kan de minister dat overzicht dan naar de Kamer
    sturen?"), and the model files that under the question that is open:
    one of the two requests that were missed in the first run on the gold
    set. The property is not put on that question: its quote names no
    letter, and what a rule got wrong there would stay for good. The
    later turn is a vermelding with its own quote, and the reply of the
    question says what was asked for later, read from that quote each
    time the reply is written.
