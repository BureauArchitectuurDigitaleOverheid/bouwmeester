"""Put what is said under the message of who says it.

The timeline posts one message per turn at speaking, with only a first
line: who and when. This reads the subtitles of the stream, files each line
under the turn it was spoken in, and writes the message again with the text
below the first line. A turn that goes on gets a message that grows.

Everything is kept in the database first and written to Mattermost from
there. Every line is a row with the turn it belongs to; the text of a turn
is its lines in order. A turn holds how much of that is in the channel, so
a message that could not be written is simply written on the next round,
and a restart continues where the reading stood.

Which turn a line belongs to is first decided by time. Around a change of
speaker the voices decide again (`debat_stemmen_service`), and a line can
move to the turn before or after. Then both messages are written anew.
