"""Hand every finished turn at speaking to the marking of questions.

The timeline posts a message per turn and the transcription puts the text
under it. This looks, a few times a minute, for turns that are over and
whose text is complete, and has each one read once
(`DebatVraagService.beoordeel_beurt`): a turn of a member for questions to
the bewindspersoon and for moties, a turn of the bewindspersoon for
toezeggingen. Every rule in here holds for both.

The chairman is not read, with one exception: when a part of the debate has
ended, the list of toezeggingen the chairman read out at its end, if there
is one (`debat_slotlijst`). Once, after every turn of that part was read.

A round of its own, not part of the timeline: reading one turn takes the
model three to fourteen seconds, and the timeline has to say who speaks
within ten.

What a turn is, is not decided here. `load_turns` of the transcription says
which words belong under which message, and this reads exactly those.

A turn is read once, so it is read when its text is final. Around a change
of speaker the voices decide whose a line is, seconds to minutes later, and
a line can go to the turn before or after. A question read under one
speaker and then moved to the other would leave a thread under the wrong
message. So a turn waits for as long as a line can still move into or out
of it; see `rows_in_play`.

One kind of turn is not left until it is over: an answer of the
bewindspersoon. A toezegging in the second minute of an answer of ten is
of use when it is said, so the part of such a turn that is final is read
while the turn goes on (`final_lines`, `DebatVraagWorker._final`), a
window at a time, and the turn counts as read only when it is over and
the rest was read as well.
