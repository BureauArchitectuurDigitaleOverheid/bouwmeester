"""The timeline: who speaks when, in the channel of a debate.

On the day of a debate this finds it on Debat Direct, puts room and stream
in the channel header, and then posts one message per turn at speaking,
each with a link to that moment in the broadcast. No transcript yet; that is
added to these same messages later.

Runs as ticks from the worker. One tick looks at every debate channel whose
debate is today, and does whatever is next for it. Everything it has done
is in the database, so a restart continues where the last tick stopped.
